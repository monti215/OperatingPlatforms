# OperatingPlatforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is looking to take their game from an Android device to be usable on all platforms to increase their user base and profits.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Identifying the problem, time constraints, and methods of how we can achieve this goal.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
while working through a design document it helps you to analyze a problem or situation and come up with ways to make it work. It is an important first step in developing code as it is intended to use while also following safety protocols. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would have to say the recommendation section. I say this because every week I learn more and more about various applications that are useful and this section will always be updated with the lates info on security features, storage management, and aplication development. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
First I try to understand what the client needs out of the application, then I look at is as if I was an end-user and how I would want to see things operate. Putting yourself on both sides of the fence helps not only your ability to develop but your ability for it to be user-friendly as well.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach is to first understand the problem or situation at hand. Once we know what the problem is, then we can go about solving that problem. How do we solve that problem? how long will it take? what do we need to be conscience of as we approach this unique problem? These are all important questiuons a developer must ask themselves as they work on new projects.
